be careful

object oriented - using class
everything should be in a class

create a new class
and call that class from another class as ClassName.FunctionName();

void means no return

public static + void or int or double... the type of return + functionName(typeOfValue Value)

you can not use another class in one file, to do that only one class must be public

in C $ is not allowed

for C x00 cFF
does not know how to display some of the characters
